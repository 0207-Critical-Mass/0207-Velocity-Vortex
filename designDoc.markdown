## What we should have by first meet:

##### Driver Control :: Do this FIRST
* Joystick control for wheels
* Some form of control for ball launching

##### Autonomous :: Do this Second
* Design each action as it's own function
    * For example, have the push cap ball as it's own function
    * Actions we should have:
        * Beacon
        * Particle Launcher(to center)
        * Move onto center vortex base
            * Complete
            * Partial
        * Move onto corner vortex ramp
            * Complete
            * Partial
        * Particle Push(to corner)
        * Push cap ball off
* First Competition Auton Goals
    * Plan 1 :: Dumbass Auton
        * Might not even be legal
        * Run around on other teams side
        * Projected Score
            * 0
    * Plan 2 :: Super Simple
        * Push cap ball
        * Park on Ramp
        * Projected Score
            * 05 + 05 = 10
    * Plan 3 :: If we can shoot into center
        * Score into center x1/2
        * Push cap ball
        * Stay completely on center vortex base
        * Projected Score
            * 15 x1/2 + 5 + 10 = 30/45
    * Plan 4 :: If we can only push
        * Push cap ball
        * Push into corner x1/2
        * Stay on ramp
        * Projected Score
            * 5 + 5 x1/2 + 10 = 20/25
    * Eventually ideal run
        * Score into center x1/2
        * Push cap ball
        * Trigger beacon x2
        * Fully climb corner ramp
        * Projected Score
            * 15 x1/2 + 5 + 30 x2 + 10 = 90/115
